## Your Situation & Mission

### Current Reality
**Work:** 8am-5pm, HCL Domino/LotusScript/Formula (legacy stack)
- JS in HTML, bad practices everywhere
- No documentation, high stress
- Limited learning opportunities
- Dead-end technology

**University:** 6pm-10pm (ends December 2025)
- 4 hours every weekday
- Final semester

**Available Time:**
- **Dec:** ~5 hours/week (survival mode)
- **Jan-July:** ~20-25 hours/week (attack mode)

### Mission Statement
**Escape legacy tech hell. Get hired at a modern company by August 2026.**

Learn modern JavaScript stack (React, NestJS, TypeScript) while working, build portfolio, ace interviews, get better job with better pay and growth opportunities.

### Core Principle
**NO AI CODE GENERATION.** Use AI as mentor only after 15 minutes of struggle. You code, you debug, you own it.

### Success Definition
**By July 26, 2026:**
- ✅ Master modern JavaScript (ES6+) + TypeScript
- ✅ Build full-stack apps (React + NestJS)
- ✅ **Containerize apps with Docker**
- ✅ **Implement CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions)**
- ✅ 5+ portfolio projects deployed
- ✅ Pass technical interviews confidently
- ✅ Multiple job offers from modern companies

## The Two-Phase Strategy

### Phase 1: Survival Mode (Dec 1 - Dec 31, 2025)
**Duration:** 5 weeks  
**Total Hours:** ~25 hours  
**Weekly Hours:** 5 hours (1 hour/day Mon-Fri)

**Goal:** Build unbreakable habit, learn foundations, don't burn out, finish university strong.

**Focus:**
- Modern JavaScript fundamentals (ES6+)
- Basic DOM manipulation
- 1 small project (To-Do List)
- Daily commits (streak is SACRED)

**Why low hours?** You're working 13-hour days (8hr work + 4hr uni + commute) until Dec 15. Sustainability > speed.

---

### Phase 2: Attack Mode (Jan 1 - July 26, 2026)
**Duration:** 30 weeks  
**Total Hours:** 600+ hours  
**Weekly Hours:** 20-25 hours (university done, full acceleration)

**Goal:** Go HARD. This is your escape window. Learn everything, build everything, get hired.

**Focus:**
- TypeScript mastery
- Backend (Express → NestJS)
- Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **DevOps Basics (Docker + CI/CD)**
- Full-stack projects (portfolio pieces)
- Algorithms + System Design
- Interview preparation
- Job applications (starting Week 25)

**Why high hours?** No more university. Work 8-5, study 5:30-9pm = 3-4 hours daily. Weekends = 5-6 hours each day.

## Learning Science & Session Protocol

### The 5 Learning Principles

**Same as before - these don't change:**

1. **Active Recall:** Answer questions from memory (post-session)
2. **Spaced Repetition:** Review at intervals (1 day, 3 days, 1 week)
3. **Interleaving:** Mix topics (concepts + LeetCode + projects)
4. **Elaborative Interrogation:** Always ask "why" and "how"
5. **Productive Struggle:** 15-minute rule before asking for help

### Session Protocol

**Adjusted for YOUR reality:**

#### Survival Mode Session (Dec): 60 min
**Goal:** Consistency over intensity.
- You have 1 hour per day. Use it wisely.
- If you finish early, review. If you run out of time, stop and continue tomorrow.

**Session breakdown:**
- 0-10min: Concept acquisition (read resources)
- 10-50min: Active practice (coding exercises)
- 50-60min: Consolidation (commit to GitHub)

**The reality:** 
- Hard topics (async/await, closures): 90min+ is FINE
- Review topics: 30-45min
- Easy topics: 45-60min

**Don't stress about time. Stress about UNDERSTANDING.**

---

#### Attack Mode Session (Jan-Jul): 50-90 min
**By January you'll be MUCH faster because:**
- Note-taking is automatic
- You know what to focus on
- Concepts build on each other
- Your brain is trained

**Typical session:**
- 0-15min: Concept acquisition
- 15-60min: Active practice  
- 60-75min: Consolidation
- 75-90min: Post-recall + planning

**Two sessions per evening:** 1.5hrs each = 3hrs total (5:30-9pm with breaks)

## The Reality of Learning Speed

### Week 1 (NOW): Slowest Week
**Session times:**
- Hard topics: 90-120min (async, closures)
- Medium topics: 60-90min (arrays, destructuring)
- Easy topics: 45-60min (template literals)

**Why slow:**
- Learning the note-taking system
- Figuring out what to write
- Building new neural pathways
- Fighting work/uni exhaustion

**This is NORMAL. Don't compare yourself to "50min target."**

---

### Week 2-3: Building Speed
**Session times:**
- Hard topics: 60-90min
- Medium topics: 50-60min
- Easy topics: 40-50min

**Why faster:**
- System is automatic
- Know what to focus on
- Concepts start connecting
- Brain is warmed up

---

### Week 4+: Consistent Pace
**Session times:**
- Most topics: 45-60min
- Very hard topics: 60-90min
- Review topics: 30-45min

**Why consistent:**
- Muscle memory built
- Note template is second nature
- Can identify important vs fluff quickly
- Learning compounds

---

### January+ (Attack Mode): Maximum Efficiency
**Session times:**
- New topics: 50-75min
- Practice/projects: 90min
- Review: 30-45min

**Why efficient:**
- 8 weeks of practice behind you
- Your brain KNOWS how to learn now
- Can do 2 sessions per evening (3hrs total)

---

## The Key Insight

**You're not trying to hit 50min from Day 1.**

**You're trying to:**
1. Understand deeply (not rush)
2. Build the habit (consistency)
3. Get faster over time (natural progression)

**Session 1: 90min → Session 2: 50min is PROOF the system works.**

**By Week 4, you'll naturally hit 45-50min for most topics.**

**Don't force speed. Speed comes from repetition.**
### The 15-Minute Rule (SACRED)

**When stuck:**
- Minutes 0-5: Understand the problem
- Minutes 5-10: Debug systematically
- Minutes 10-15: Research & experiment
- Minute 15: Ask mentor with specific format

---

## Session Templates & Questions (Week by Week)

**Use these for your note-taking. Copy the questions into each session's .md file.**

### Week 1: Modern JavaScript Basics

];

// Practice:
// 1. Get array of just names (map)
// 2. Get array of active users (filter)
// 3. Get sum of all ages (reduce)

## How to Use These Questions

### 1. Copy Into Your Session Notes
Before each session, copy the relevant pre/post questions into your notes file.

### 2. Answer Pre-Questions BEFORE Learning
Write your guesses. Even "no idea" is valid. This primes your brain.

### 3. Answer Post-Questions FROM MEMORY
Close everything. Answer without looking. Then check your accuracy.

### 4. Track Your Understanding
If you can't answer a post-question, that's a gap. Review that specific part.

### 5. Use for Review
Come back in 3 days and answer the questions again (spaced repetition).

- LotusScript (don't even mention it)
- Legacy tech (frame as "maintaining critical systems")

**Frame Your Story:**
> "Currently working as a backend developer, independently learned modern JavaScript stack (React, NestJS, TypeScript) through intensive self-study and project-based learning. Built 5+ full-stack applications demonstrating proficiency in modern web technologies. Seeking to leverage problem-solving skills and new technical expertise in a growth-oriented role."

## The Escape Velocity Formula

**Current situation:**
- Legacy tech (dead-end)
- Bad practices (limiting growth)
- High stress (burning out)
- Low salary (underpaid)
- No future (technology is dying)

**8 months from now:**
- Modern tech (React, NestJS, TypeScript)
- Best practices (clean code, testing)
- Normal stress (sustainable)
- Better salary (modern tech pays 30-50% more)
- Growth opportunities (unlimited)

**What it takes:**
- 660+ hours of focused learning
- 5-7 portfolio projects
- 50+ LeetCode problems
- Daily consistency (240-day streak)
- Never giving up

**The math:**
- Dec: ~25 hours (survival)
- Jan-Jul: ~600 hours (attack)
- **Total: ~625 hours = ESCAPE VELOCITY**
