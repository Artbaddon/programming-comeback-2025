## Mission Statement

**Transform from junior developer (10/100) to hireable mid-level engineer (70/100) in 8 months through deliberate practice, NO AI code generation, and building real projects.**

### Core Stats
- **Total Hours:** 480
- **Weekly Commitment:** 15 hours (5 weekdays × 1hr + 2 weekend days × 5hrs)
- **Projects:** 15+ fully deployed applications
- **LeetCode Problems:** 100+ (Easy → Medium)
- **Goal:** Land a job by July 26, 2026

### ⚠️ CORE PRINCIPLE: NO AI CODE GENERATION
**Use AI only as a mentor after 15 minutes of struggle. No autocomplete, no generated solutions. You code, you debug, you own it. This builds real engineering skills.**

### Success Metrics (Track Weekly)
- ✅ 13-15 hours logged per week minimum
- ✅ Daily GitHub commits (green squares)
- ✅ 2 LeetCode Easy problems per week minimum (weeks 3+)

## Evidence-Based Learning Science

### The 5 Learning Principles (Backed by Research)

#### 1. Active Recall
**What:** Retrieving information from memory strengthens neural pathways  
**How:** At the end of each session, close your notes and answer 4 recall questions from memory  
**Why it works:** Retrieval practice is 2-3x more effective than re-reading

#### 2. Spaced Repetition
**What:** Review material at increasing intervals (1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks)  
**How:** Friday reviews cover the week. Weekend projects force you to recall weekday concepts  
**Why it works:** Fights the forgetting curve, moves info to long-term memory

#### 3. Interleaving
**What:** Mix different topics rather than blocking one topic  
**How:** Alternate between concepts, LeetCode, and projects in same week  
**Why it works:** Improves long-term retention and problem-solving transfer

#### 4. Elaborative Interrogation
**What:** Ask yourself 'why' and 'how' constantly  
**How:** For every concept ask: "Why does this exist? How does this work under the hood? When would I use this?"  
**Why it works:** Forces deeper processing and understanding vs memorization

#### 5. Productive Struggle
**What:** Difficulty enhances learning. Being stuck for 15min > getting answer immediately  
**How:** 15-minute rule is sacred. Struggle builds debugging intuition  
**Why it works:** Creates stronger neural pathways through effortful retrieval

### The Feynman Technique (Your Daily Method)
1. **Choose a concept** - Today's topic
2. **Teach it to a child** - Explain in simple terms (rubber duck/journal)
3. **Identify gaps** - Where you stumble = what you don't understand
4. **Review & simplify** - Go back to source, rebuild understanding

**Apply this at the end of every session with post-session questions. If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it.**

---

## Session Protocol (The Sacred Ritual)

Every single session follows this structure. Consistency builds discipline. Discipline builds skills.

### Pre-Session (5 minutes)
1. Review today's pre-session questions in your mind (don't write yet)
2. Set specific goal: "Today I will understand X and build Y"
3. Write goal on paper, visible during session
4. Close all distractions (phone in other room, only docs/editor open)
5. Set 50-minute timer

### During Session (50 minutes)

#### Minutes 0-15: Concept Acquisition
- Read documentation/watch video with full focus
- Take notes in YOUR words, not copy-paste
- Draw diagrams for complex concepts
- Identify what you don't understand yet

#### Minutes 15-40: Active Practice
- Type every code example yourself (no copy-paste)
- Modify examples to test edge cases
- Build the day's coding challenge/exercise
- STRUGGLE. If stuck, follow 15-minute rule

#### Minutes 40-50: Consolidation
- Test your code thoroughly
- Add comments explaining WHY, not what
- Commit to GitHub with descriptive message
- Prepare for post-session questions

### Post-Session (10-15 minutes)
1. Close all resources and code
2. Answer the 4 post-session questions from MEMORY
3. Check your answers against notes - mark what you got wrong
4. Write tomorrow's focus based on gaps
5. Optional: Share learnings with mentor for feedback

**Why this matters:** Active recall is the most effective learning technique. Retrieving information strengthens memory far more than re-reading.

### Non-Negotiable Rules
- ❌ No AI code generation (mentor questions only after 15min struggle)
- ❌ No mindless tutorial following - understand each line
- ❌ Console.log everything when debugging
- ❌ If confused, simplify the problem and rebuild understanding

---

## The 15-Minute Struggle Rule

When you get stuck on a problem, this is your debugging protocol:

### Minutes 0-5: Understand the problem
- Read the error message 3 times carefully
- What did you expect to happen?
- What actually happened?
- Where exactly does it break?

### Minutes 5-10: Debug systematically
- Console.log every variable before the error
- Comment out code to isolate the problem
- Test with simpler input
- Check documentation for the function/method

### Minutes 10-15: Research & experiment
- Google the exact error message
- Try 2-3 different approaches
- Read Stack Overflow answers carefully
- Form a hypothesis about what's wrong

### Minute 15: Ask your mentor
Come with this format:
```
I'm trying to: [specific goal]
I expected: [expected behavior]
I got: [actual behavior/error]
I've tried: [list 2-3 things]
I think: [your hypothesis]
Code: [paste relevant 10-20 lines]
```

## Dealing with Executive Dysfunction

### The No Zero Days Rule
Even 10 minutes counts. Open VS Code, write ONE function, commit it. Progress > perfection.

### Body Doubling
Use Focusmate.com for 50-minute accountability sessions. Having someone "there" helps focus.

### Task Rotation
Can't focus on project? Do 1 LeetCode. Can't do that? Watch 1 video. Can't do that? Read 1 doc page. Keep moving.

### Environment Setup
- Phone in other room (or in drawer)
- Only docs + editor open
- Wear same "coding outfit" to build ritual
- Same desk, same time = routine

### Reward System
After each session:
- ✅ Check it off visually
- ✅ Commit to GitHub (green square dopamine)
- ✅ Tweet your win
- ✅ Small treat (coffee, walk, etc.)

### When You Want to Quit

**Read this:**
1. Look at your Week 1 code. You've already grown.
2. Remember: 480 hours is LONG. One bad day doesn't matter.
3. The difference between success and failure is just showing up tomorrow.
4. Every senior dev you admire felt this way. They showed up anyway.

### Emergency Protocol (Really Stuck)
1. Take a 5-minute walk
2. Come back and explain the problem to rubber duck
3. Try ONE more thing
4. If still stuck after 15min total → ask mentor
5. Move to different task (LeetCode, reading, refactoring)

## Final Notes

### This is Your Bible
- When in doubt, come back here
- When you want to quit, read this
- When you're lost, check the schedule
- When you succeed, remember this journey

### The Reality
- **Weeks 1-4:** You'll feel slow. That's normal. Embrace the suck.
- **Weeks 8-12:** You'll have "holy shit, I get it" moments. That's the turn.
- **Weeks 16-20:** You'll build things that actually work. That's confidence.
- **Weeks 24+:** You'll interview and people will say "we'd love to have you."

**But ONLY if you start today and don't skip days.**

### Mentor Interaction Protocol

**When to come to mentor:**
- After 15 minutes of productive struggle
- For code review after completing feature
- Weekly check-ins on Friday
- When roadmap needs adjustment

**What mentor does:**
- Explains concepts after you've tried
- Reviews code and suggests improvements
- Answers "why" questions about architecture
- Adjusts plan based on your progress
- Kicks your ass when procrastinating

**What mentor does NOT do:**
- Write your code
- Fix your bugs (helps you find them)
- Generate solutions before you struggle
