### Saturday, Nov 1 - Day 1 🎉
**Hours:** 2.5 hours (2 sessions!)
**Sessions:**
1. ✅ Variables & Scope (6:00pm-7:30pm, 1.5hr)
2. ✅ Arrow Functions (9:00pm-9:50pm, 50min)

**Key learnings:**
- Block scope with let/const vs var
- Arrow functions don't have their own 'this'
- Lexical vs dynamic binding (still fuzzy, need examples)
- When NOT to use arrows (object methods)

**Commits:**
- `Day 1 Session 1: Variables and block scope practice`
- `Day 1 Session 2: Arrow functions and lexical this`

**Progress:**
- Session 2 was FASTER than Session 1 (momentum building!)
- Focus improved in Session 2 (no distractions)
- Understanding is solid (7/10)
- Did 2 sessions on Day 1 (overachieving)

**Struggles:**
- Energy dropped by evening (4/10 by Session 2)
- Lexical environment still confusing (need to research)
- Late night coding might not be ideal

**What went well:**
- Came BACK after break and did Session 2 (consistency!)
- Faster on Session 2 (learning the system)
- Arrow functions clicked despite low energy

**Tomorrow (Sunday, Nov 2):**
- Try MORNING session (test if energy is better)
- Session 3: Destructuring (1 hour)
- Session 4: Start CLI Task Manager (2-3 hours)
- Goal: 3-4 hours total

**Reflection:**
Day 1 exceeded expectations. Did 2 sessions when I only planned 1.
The habit is forming. Keep this momentum.
