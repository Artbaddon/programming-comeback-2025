### Saturday, Nov 1 - Day 1 🎉  
**Hours:** 2.5 hours (2 sessions)  

**Sessions:**  
1. ✅ Variables & Scope (6:00 pm–7:30 pm, 1.5 hr)  
2. ✅ Arrow Functions (9:00 pm–9:50 pm, 50 min)  

**Key Learnings:**  
- Block scope with `let`/`const` vs `var`  
- Arrow functions don’t have their own `this`  
- Lexical vs dynamic binding (still fuzzy)  
- When **not** to use arrow functions (object methods)  

**Commits:**  
- `Day 1 Session 1: Variables and block scope practice`  
- `Day 1 Session 2: Arrow functions and lexical this`  

**Progress:**  
- Session 2 was faster than Session 1 (momentum building)  
- Focus improved in Session 2 (no distractions)  
- Understanding: **7/10**  
- Did 2 sessions — overachieved  

**Struggles:**  
- Energy dropped by evening (4/10)  
- Lexical environment still confusing  
- Late sessions lower focus  

**What went well:**  
- Came back after break for Session 2 (consistency)  
- Faster learning pace  
- Arrow functions finally clicked  

**Tomorrow (Sunday, Nov 2):**  
- Try morning session  
- Session 3: Destructuring (1 hr)  
- Session 4: Start CLI Task Manager (2–3 hr)  
- Goal: 3–4 hours total  

**Reflection:**  
Day 1 exceeded expectations. The habit started forming — keep momentum.

### Sunday, Nov 2 - Day 2 🚀  
**Hours:** 2 hr 10 min (2 sessions)  

**Sessions:**  
3. ✅ Promises (7:25 pm–9:05 pm, 80 min)  
4. ✅ Promises Chaining (9:35 pm–10:25 pm, 50 min)  

**Key Learnings:**  
- Each `.then()` returns a **new promise**  
- Chaining allows **sequential async steps** without nesting  
- Returning a promise inside `.then()` delays the next one until it resolves  
- `.catch()` handles any rejection in the chain  
- Learned real-world chaining with `fetch` and `loadScript()` examples  

**Commits:**  
- `Day 2 Session 1: Promises basics, then-catch-finally examples`  
- `Day 2 Session 2: Promises chaining examples with fetch and scripts`  

**Progress:**  
- Understood the internal flow of chained promises  
- Cleaner mental model of how `.then()` passes values  
- Focus consistent through both sessions  
- Understanding: **7/10 → 8/10**  

**Struggles:**  
- Sometimes confused by value passing vs returning new promises  
- Need deeper review of `.catch()` vs `.then(onRejected)`  

**What went well:**  
- Maintained focus late in the day  
- Code examples worked perfectly  
- Solidified async fundamentals  

**Tomorrow (Monday, Nov 3):**  
- Session 5: `async/await` (rewrite chaining examples)  
- Optional: quick review quiz on promises  
- Goal: 1 hour focused  

**Reflection:**  
Good recovery and sustained momentum. Async flow starting to click — solid foundation for `async/await`.  

**Progress:**
