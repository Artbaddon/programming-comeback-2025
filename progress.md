### Saturday, Nov 1 - Day 1 🎉  
**Hours:** 2.5 hours (2 sessions)  

**Sessions:**  
1. ✅ Variables & Scope (6:00 pm–7:30 pm, 1.5 hr)  
2. ✅ Arrow Functions (9:00 pm–9:50 pm, 50 min)  

**Key Learnings:**  
- Block scope with `let`/`const` vs `var`  
- Arrow functions don’t have their own `this`  
- Lexical vs dynamic binding (still fuzzy)  
- When **not** to use arrow functions (object methods)  

**Commits:**  
- `Day 1 Session 1: Variables and block scope practice`  
- `Day 1 Session 2: Arrow functions and lexical this`  

**Progress:**  
- Session 2 was faster than Session 1 (momentum building)  
- Focus improved in Session 2 (no distractions)  
- Understanding: **7/10**  
- Did 2 sessions — overachieved  

**Struggles:**  
- Energy dropped by evening (4/10)  
- Lexical environment still confusing  
- Late sessions lower focus  

**What went well:**  
- Came back after break for Session 2 (consistency)  
- Faster learning pace  
- Arrow functions finally clicked  

**Tomorrow (Sunday, Nov 2):**  
- Try morning session  
- Session 3: Destructuring (1 hr)  
- Session 4: Start CLI Task Manager (2–3 hr)  
- Goal: 3–4 hours total  

**Reflection:**  
Day 1 exceeded expectations. The habit started forming — keep momentum.
