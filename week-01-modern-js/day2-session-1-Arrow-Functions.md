# Session 1: [Arrow Functions]
**Date:**  Wednesday December 12
**Time:** [22:30 - 23:10]
**Duration:** 40 minutes
**Review Date:** [Date + 3 days] (Spaced Repetition)

## Pre-Session Questions (Answer BEFORE you start)
1. What it is?

2.Why it exists?
   

3.How it works

4.When to use
   
**My guesses:**
- Arrow function are basically a syntactic sugar or another way to write a function.
- It exists to make a little bit easier to write functions.
- For using this, you have to initialize a variable with the name and then in parenthesis you will add the args, then => and the function itself with {}, you can also create a 1 line function if the return value of the function itself is in the same statement, in this case is not necessary to add {}.
- In anonymous functions, or when you want to assign a variable to be a function, also you may use it in callbacks because is easier to write than normal anonymous functions, they have a key difference and is that they do not create their own scope, so you can access the inner scope easily, so for example you have a method to call an attribute in a class.

## Notes (Write in MY words during session)

### [Main Concept 1]

**What it is:**
    -Is another way to create functions, is a more simple and concise syntax, often better than function expressions.
**Why it exists:**
    -To make the process of writing certain functions more easy to do.
**How it works:**
    -You first declare a variable, then assign the value of () that will contain the args and => is the expression itself so you have: (...args) => expression
**Example:**
```javascript
// Code example with comments explaining each line
```

**When to use:**
    -Whenever you want to create a functions in a more easy way, in callbacks to pass a anonymous function in less code.

## Daily Exercises (The "3 Tasks") ✅
*Paste the 3 exercises from the Roadmap here*

1. [x] **Exercise 1:** Convert a standard function declaration to an arrow function.
2. [x] **Exercise 2:** Create an arrow function that implicitly returns an object (hint: wrap in parentheses).
3. [x] **Exercise 3:** Write a one-line arrow function that takes two numbers and returns their product.

**My Solution Code / Notes:**
```javascript

## Post-Session Recall (CLOSE EVERYTHING FIRST!)

**1.  What it is?**
    -Is a simpler way to write functions.
---

**2. Why it exists?**

    -It exists to make the writing of functions more simpler in syntaxis
---

**3. How it works?**

    -You declare a variable and then you can assign the value to the funciton itself, with the syntaxis: (args) => declarations, the main key is that this can be used in other function calls like callbacks.
---

**4. When to use?**

    -You use wnen you want a simpler or shorter Function or when you are passing a function as a callback.

---

**5. The "EL15" Summary (Explain Like I'm 5)**
-So imagine you have a toy car and you want to draw it, this car has a lot of colors and fomrs so is hard to draw, but you have another car that is the same but is easier to draw, so an arrow function is that, is a draw of a car but in a more simpler way.
