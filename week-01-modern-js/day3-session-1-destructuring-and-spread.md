## Pre-Session Questions (Answer BEFORE you start)
1. What is destructuring?
2. Why it exists?
3. How it works?
4. When to use?

**My guesses:**
- destructuring is a type of syntax that let you manage the attributes of the objects in a more easy way
- It exist to improve the way we manage object properties
- You basically declare a variable and then all the attributes you want to take from the obj, you give them the name in the variable name and then you assign the obj, th attributes has to be in [] to be able to use it, for example let [name, age] = personObj;
- You normally use it when you want to access certain attributes of an obj and not the whole obj itself, like just taking as variables the attributes you want.

## Notes (Write in MY words during session)

### [Main Concept 1]

**What it is:**

-Is a special syntax that let us unpack arrays or objects into the variable we like.
**Why it exists:**

-To solve the issue of having too many attributes of an obj and just need a bunch.

**How it works:**
[Mechanism/process]
You basically declare a var with the name of the data you want to take, in this case the order is important if is an arr, so the first item will be the first var you will take, etc.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Code example with comments explaining each line
    let arr = ["John", "Smith"]
    //Here we declare the var arr that have a name and a surname
    let [firstName, surname] = arr
    //We say that the first item of the arr will is now called firstName and the same with the second value

    let [name1, name2] = "Victor Doom".split(" ");
    //Here we use it because split return an array
```

**When to use:**
-You want to take some values from an obj or arrays and don't really want to take the whole data
