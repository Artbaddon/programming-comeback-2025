# Session 2: Array methods
**Date:** Nov 3, 2025
**Time:** 17:35 - 18:25
**Duration:** 50 minutes

---

## Pre-Session Questions (Answer BEFORE you start)
1. What are array methods
2. Why we use array methods
3. When to use array methosd

**My guesses:**
- Array methods are methods for arrays that are meant to make the transformations or managment of the arrays easier
- We use the methods because there is some operations in arrays that are repetitive so js already has some built them in.
- When we want to do some operations to an array

## Notes 

### Array methods

**What it is:**
Array methods are methods that the array object provides to make things easier, they are split into groups:

Add/remove:
Methods to add or remove items.

Splice: 
It can insert, remove and replace elemements

Slice:
returns a new copy from an array

Concat:
Returns a new copy from an array with something added

ForEach:
this 

**Why it exists:**
Array methods make the managment of arrays easier

**How it works:**
they are a lot of them the most important ones are:

push: Adds item to the end.
Pop: removes an item of the end.
shift: removes an item from the beginning
unshift: adds item to the beginning
splice: it can delete, insert and replace, it need some args: the start position, the number of deletions and the elements to add.
slice: it returns a copy from an array of the elements between a range, start and end
concat: creates an copy from an array and additional items

**Example:**
```javascript
// Code example with comments explaining each line
```

**When to use:**
-When you want to modify an array
