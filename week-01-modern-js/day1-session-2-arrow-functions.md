## Pre-Session Questions (Answer BEFORE you start)
1. What are arrow functions?
2. Why we use the arrow functions?
3. When to use the arrow functions?

**My guesses:**
- Arrow functions are a type of function that is like a shorthand of a whole function but different
- We use arrow functions because it let us share the same scope, it create its own but let us use the scope of the father
- We use arrow functions when we want to for example assign the value of a function to a varible and dont want to create a function, this is called anonymous functions

## Notes (Write in MY words during session)

### Arrow functions

**What it is:**
Arrow functions are basically an simplier and concise way to create functions, is something more synctactical and is often better than functions but have some differences.

They dont have this, means that when you use this inside of them, it takes it from outside

They cant be called with new, so they cant be constructors

They do not have arguments, meaning that they cant access the propetrty args of a normal functions
**Why it exists:**
Its often used for simplying the way we write functions and is a way to shorten the process of creating and using functions. is often used for writing small functions.

**How it works:**
There are some ways of how you can use them, for example you can create a 1 line function that takes 2 args and if the return is only 1 line, it can be implicit like let var = (a ,b) => a + b, in this case the return is not necessary because it is only one line.

they can also be multiline in which the only change will be that you will have to put {} and a return value


**When to use:**
They are often used when you want to create functions that dont leave the current context

## Aha Moments 💡
- How this worked on arrow functions
- They cannot be constructors
- Why they worked when used in for each

## Post-Session Recall (CLOSE EVERYTHING FIRST!)

**1. What are arrow functions**

Arrow functions are a way of simplify the writing of functions, they are not only a syntactical sugar but have some differences

---

**2. Why we use the arrow functions?**

They are used often when you want to maintain the context of for example the object that you are in, they are used too for basic functions because they can be 1 line



---


**3.  When to use the arrow functions?**
We use arrow functions whenever we want to access the same context or just want to have a shorter way of writing a basic function

---

**4. What's one thing I still don't fully understand?**

## Next Session Focus
- Promises & async/await
- Search about lexico enviroment

---

## Reflection

**What went well:**
- I understood how the arrow functions work and

**What was hard:**
- That the arrow functions doesnt have this, and also that they are not capable of using the property args that the functions often do

**Time management:**
- Did I stay focused? YEs
- Any distractions? No
