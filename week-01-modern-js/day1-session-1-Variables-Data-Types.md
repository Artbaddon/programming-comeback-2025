## Pre-Session Questions (Answer BEFORE you start)
1. What are Variables:
 
2. Why we use Variables
   -
3. When do we use variables:
   - When you want to name data and have it saved

**My guesses:**
- Variables are basically a pointer to a direction in memory that you can storage or save certain value that is identified by a name
- We use variables because is a way to name and give an alias or a identification to the data that we are using.
- Almost always because you use them when you want to name data and have it saved.

## Notes (Write in MY words during session)

### [Main Concept 1]

**What it is:**
A variable is basically a named storage for data, is like a box

**Why it exists:**
It basically used whenever you want to save data and give them a name

**How it works:**
When you delcare a variable, you use let or const, let is for variables that can change its value once you assign something,
For example: let message; message="Hello"; Here we are declaring that the variable message will have the value of "Hello".
You will also have Const, meaning constant, basically a type of variable that you can only assign the value once, if you 
try to redeclare the value of a previous constant, it will not let you execute. 
Whenever you declare a variable you basically save the data in a space in the memory, like a box, and the key to access this
box is the name of the variable.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Code example with comments explaining each line
```

**When to use:**
You use it when you want to save some data and give it a name to be able to use it later so almost always.

## Daily Exercises (The "3 Tasks") ✅
*Paste the 3 exercises from the Roadmap here*
  1. Swap two variables without using a temporary variable (or with one).
  2. Create a `const` object and modify one of its properties (prove `const` isn't immutable).
  3. Use template literals to log a formatted user profile string (e.g., "Name: X, Age: Y").n]
